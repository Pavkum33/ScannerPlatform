# üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION STEPS - READY TO GO!

## CRITICAL OPTIMIZATIONS FOR 100% DATA RETRIEVAL

### ‚úÖ Safety Measures Implemented

1. **Batch Size**: Reduced to **3 symbols** per batch (was 5)
2. **Retry Logic**: **5 retries** per symbol with exponential backoff
3. **Delays**:
   - 2 seconds between each symbol
   - 10 seconds between batches
   - 15 seconds before final retry
4. **Data Validation**: Minimum 200 days required (rejects incomplete data)
5. **Final Retry Phase**: Failed symbols get one more chance with longer wait

### üìä Expected Timing

With these SAFE settings:
- **Per Symbol**: ~2-3 seconds + retries if needed
- **Per Batch (3 symbols)**: ~10-15 seconds
- **Total for 154 symbols**: ~60-90 minutes (SAFE and COMPLETE)

Better to take longer and get 100% data than rush and miss records!

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION

### Prerequisites
```bash
# 1. Install PostgreSQL (if not installed)
# Windows: Download from https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
# Linux: sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

# 2. Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### PHASE 1: Initial Setup (One-time, ~60-90 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to database directory
cd database

# Run Phase 1 setup
python setup_phase1.py
```

This will:
1. ‚úÖ Create database and schema
2. ‚úÖ Load 154 F&O symbols
3. ‚úÖ Fetch 365 days √ó 154 symbols = 56,210 daily candles
4. ‚úÖ Each symbol gets 5 retry attempts
5. ‚úÖ Failed symbols get final retry phase
6. ‚úÖ Generate weekly/monthly aggregates

**Monitor the output** - it will show:
- Current symbol being fetched
- Number of days retrieved
- Any retries happening
- Final success/error count

### PHASE 2: Daily Operations

```bash
# Run daily operations menu
python phase2_daily_ops.py
```

Menu Options:
1. **EOD Update** - Fetch today's data only (4 PM)
2. **Smart Scan** - Use cached DB data (2-5 seconds!)
3. **Health Check** - Verify data completeness

### üîç Verify Data Completeness

After Phase 1 setup, check:
```sql
-- Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -U postgres -d pattern_scanner_db

-- Check how many symbols have data
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT symbol_id) FROM daily_ohlc;

-- Check data per symbol
SELECT s.symbol, COUNT(*) as days_count
FROM daily_ohlc d
JOIN symbols s ON d.symbol_id = s.symbol_id
GROUP BY s.symbol
ORDER BY days_count DESC;

-- Should see ~250 trading days per symbol
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### Why These Settings?

1. **Batch size = 3**: DHAN API can handle 3 concurrent requests safely
2. **5 retries**: Network issues, temporary API glitches covered
3. **2 sec between symbols**: Prevents rate limiting
4. **200 days minimum**: Ensures quality data (250 trading days/year)

### If Any Symbol Fails After 5 Retries

Check:
1. Is the symbol delisted?
2. Is DHAN security ID correct?
3. Try manually after some time

### Daily Routine

**Morning**:
- Run scan using cached data (instant)

**4:00 PM** (after market close):
- Run EOD update (fetches today's candle only)
- Takes ~30 seconds for all symbols

**5:00 PM**:
- Run health check
- Verify all symbols are up-to-date

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Phase 1 is successful when:
- ‚úÖ 150+ symbols have data (out of 154)
- ‚úÖ Each symbol has 200+ days
- ‚úÖ Database size is 50-100 MB
- ‚úÖ Scan runs in 2-5 seconds

Phase 2 is successful when:
- ‚úÖ Daily updates complete in ~30 seconds
- ‚úÖ No API rate limiting errors
- ‚úÖ All scans use DB (0 API calls)

## üö¶ GO LIVE!

```bash
# Start implementation now:
cd database
python setup_phase1.py

# Answer 'yes' when prompted
# Monitor the progress
# Takes 60-90 minutes for COMPLETE data
```

**Remember**: We're fetching 56,000+ data points. Taking 90 minutes ensures we get EVERYTHING without missing a single record!
